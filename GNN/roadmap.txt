OBJECTIVES
- network reconstruction based on attributes unknown (cora network)
- network reconsytuction nased on general features of networks, trying to generalize for unknown networks

STEPS AND FUNCTIONS
- function to currupt the adjency matrix (and see how varyig p changes the benchmarks)
- function to from graph to adjency matrix and edge list and viceversa
- function from graph to feature (select features)
- function to benchmark the performances (score, AUC, times existing link has output higher than non existing link)
- function training, input(edge list, features), output(loss)
- function from k edges, k non edges and give out a mix (cat) of those two
